# Costa-Loop-and-Viterbi-algorithm-to-determine-phase-frequency-offset

* Carried out investigation and comparison of the Impact of phase and frequency offset on a signal for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying(QPSK) & 8-Phase Shift Keying(PSK) Modulation schemes.
* Implemented the Viterbi-Viterbi algorithm to estimate frequency offsets.
* Designed Costa Loop for achieving carrier frequency & phase synchronization for QPSK & 8-PSK.
